This code provides utility functions for finding the program-derived addresses (PDA) of bank vaults and their authorities, as well as a trait for numerical operations with tolerance. 

The `find_bank_vault_pda` function takes a bank public key and a `BankVaultType` enum as arguments, and returns a tuple containing the PDA and a nonce. The PDA is derived from the bank seed and the program ID using the `find_program_address` method from the `Pubkey` struct. This function can be used to generate the PDA for a specific bank vault type, which can then be used to interact with the corresponding account on the Solana blockchain.

The `find_bank_vault_authority_pda` function is similar to `find_bank_vault_pda`, but it generates the PDA for the authority account associated with the bank vault. This can be used to authorize transactions involving the bank vault account.

The `NumTraitsWithTolerance` trait provides two methods for numerical operations with tolerance: `is_zero_with_tolerance` and `is_positive_with_tolerance`. These methods take a tolerance value as an argument and return a boolean indicating whether the number is within the tolerance range of zero or positive, respectively. This trait is implemented for the `I80F48` fixed-point decimal type, which is used extensively throughout the project for financial calculations.

Overall, these utility functions and trait are important components of the marginfi-v2 project, as they enable the program to interact with bank vault and authority accounts on the Solana blockchain and perform financial calculations with tolerance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `find_bank_vault_pda` and `find_bank_vault_authority_pda` functions?
- These functions are used to find the program-derived address (PDA) and bump seed for a given bank and vault type.

2. What is the `NumTraitsWithTolerance` trait used for?
- This trait is used to define methods for checking if a given `I80F48` fixed-point number is zero or positive with a certain tolerance.

3. What is the significance of the `bank_seed` and `bank_authority_seed` macros?
- These macros are used to generate a seed for the program-derived address (PDA) based on the bank and vault type, which is used to ensure uniqueness of the PDA.
