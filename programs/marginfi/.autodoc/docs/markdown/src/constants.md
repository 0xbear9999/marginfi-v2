This code defines various constants and types used in the MarginFi-v2 project. 

The constants include seed values for different vaults and authorities, as well as the Pyth ID for different networks. The Pyth ID is used to identify the Pyth network, which provides price feeds for various assets. The seed values are used to generate the public keys for the corresponding vaults and authorities. 

The code also defines various fixed-point numbers used in the project, such as the fees charged for liquidation and insurance, as well as the number of seconds in a year. These fixed-point numbers are used to perform calculations involving decimal values with high precision. 

Additionally, the code defines various thresholds used to handle edge cases and artifacts resulting from binary fraction arithmetic. For example, any balance below 1 SPL token amount is treated as none, and a comparison threshold is used to account for arithmetic artifacts on balances. 

Overall, this code provides a set of constants and types that are used throughout the MarginFi-v2 project to perform calculations and generate public keys for different vaults and authorities. 

Example usage:

```rust
use marginfi_v2::{LIQUIDITY_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED, PYTH_ID};

// Generate the public key for the liquidity vault authority
let liquidity_vault_authority_key = Pubkey::create_with_seed(
    &program_id,
    LIQUIDITY_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED,
    &margin_account_key,
)?;

// Use the Pyth ID to fetch price feeds for various assets
let pyth_client = PythClient::new_with_state(
    &pyth_program_id,
    PYTH_ID,
    pyth_account_info.clone(),
    pyth_state_info.clone(),
)?;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cfg_if` block and how does it work?
- The `cfg_if` block is used to conditionally compile code based on the current feature flag. It checks if the `mainnet-beta` or `devnet` feature is enabled and sets the `PYTH_ID` constant accordingly.

2. What is the significance of the `LIQUIDATION_LIQUIDATOR_FEE` and `LIQUIDATION_INSURANCE_FEE` constants?
- These constants represent the fees charged for liquidation by the liquidator and insurance vault, respectively. They are currently set to 0.025.

3. What is the purpose of the `CONF_INTERVAL_MULTIPLE` constant?
- This constant represents the range that contains 95% of the price data distribution and is used in Pyth Network's best practices for price feeds. It is currently set to 2.12.
