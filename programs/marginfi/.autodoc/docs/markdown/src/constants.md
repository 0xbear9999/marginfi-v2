This code defines various constants and types used in the MarginFi-v2 project. 

First, it imports necessary modules and libraries such as `anchor_lang`, `fixed`, `fixed_macro`, and `solana_program`. 

Next, it defines several constants related to the project, such as seed values for different vaults (`LIQUIDITY_VAULT_SEED`, `INSURANCE_VAULT_SEED`, `FEE_VAULT_SEED`) and their corresponding authority seeds (`LIQUIDITY_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED`, `INSURANCE_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED`, `FEE_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED`). These seeds are used to generate public keys for the vaults and their authorities.

The code also defines a constant `PYTH_ID` which is a public key used to identify the Pyth network. The value of this constant depends on the current network configuration (`mainnet-beta`, `devnet`, or other).

Other constants defined in the code include `LIQUIDATION_LIQUIDATOR_FEE` and `LIQUIDATION_INSURANCE_FEE`, which represent the fees charged for liquidation, and `SECONDS_PER_YEAR`, which is the number of seconds in a year. 

The code also defines `MAX_PRICE_AGE_SEC`, which is the maximum age of a price in seconds, and `CONF_INTERVAL_MULTIPLE`, which is a constant used to calculate the range that contains 95% of the price data distribution. 

Finally, the code defines `USDC_EXPONENT`, which is the exponent used for USDC token amounts, `MAX_ORACLE_KEYS`, which is the maximum number of oracle keys allowed, and `EMPTY_BALANCE_THRESHOLD` and `ZERO_AMOUNT_THRESHOLD`, which are thresholds used to account for arithmetic artifacts on balances.

Overall, this code provides important constants and types used throughout the MarginFi-v2 project, allowing for consistency and ease of use across different modules and functions. For example, the `LIQUIDITY_VAULT_SEED` and `LIQUIDITY_VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED` constants can be used to generate the public key for the liquidity vault and its authority, respectively, in different parts of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cfg_if` block and how does it work?
- The `cfg_if` block is used to conditionally compile code based on the current feature flag. It checks if the `mainnet-beta` or `devnet` feature is enabled and sets the `PYTH_ID` constant accordingly. If neither feature is enabled, it sets `PYTH_ID` to a default value.

2. What is the significance of the `I80F48` type and how is it used in this code?
- The `I80F48` type is a fixed-point decimal type with 80 bits for the integer part and 48 bits for the fractional part. It is used to represent various constants in the code, such as fees and time intervals, with high precision.

3. What is the purpose of the `EMPTY_BALANCE_THRESHOLD` and `ZERO_AMOUNT_THRESHOLD` constants?
- The `EMPTY_BALANCE_THRESHOLD` constant is used to treat any balance below 1 SPL token amount as none, to account for any artifacts resulting from binary fraction arithmetic. The `ZERO_AMOUNT_THRESHOLD` constant is used as a comparison threshold to account for arithmetic artifacts on balances.
