The `lending_pool_collect_bank_fees` function is responsible for collecting fees from a lending pool bank and distributing them to the appropriate vaults. This function is part of the `marginfi-v2` project and is located in a file within the project.

The function takes in a context object that contains various accounts, including the lending pool bank, liquidity vault authority, insurance vault, fee vault, liquidity vault, and the marginfi group. The function first loads the lending pool bank and the marginfi group from their respective accounts.

The function then calculates the amount of insurance fees and group fees that need to be collected from the bank. It does this by subtracting the outstanding fees from the available liquidity in the liquidity vault. The function then withdraws the fees from the liquidity vault and transfers them to the appropriate vaults.

Finally, the function emits an event that contains information about the fees collected and the outstanding fees. This event can be used to track the fees collected by the lending pool bank.

This function is an important part of the `marginfi-v2` project as it ensures that fees are collected and distributed correctly. It can be used by other functions within the project that need to collect fees from a lending pool bank. For example, a function that allows users to deposit funds into the lending pool may use this function to collect fees from the bank and distribute them to the appropriate vaults.

Example usage:

```rust
let ctx = Context::new(accounts);
lending_pool_collect_bank_fees(ctx)?;
```
