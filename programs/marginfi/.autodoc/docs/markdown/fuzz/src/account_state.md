The `AccountsState` module provides a set of functions for creating and managing Solana accounts used in the MarginFi v2 project. It includes functions for creating Solana system accounts, SPL token accounts, and Pyth oracle accounts. 

The `AccountsState` struct contains a `Bump` allocator used to allocate memory for the accounts. The `new()` function creates a new `AccountsState` instance with a new `Bump` allocator. 

The `random_pubkey()` function generates a new random `Pubkey` using the `rand` crate and the `Bump` allocator. 

The `new_sol_account()` function creates a new Solana system account with the specified number of lamports. The `new_sol_account_with_pubkey()` function creates a new Solana system account with the specified `Pubkey` and number of lamports. 

The `new_token_mint()` function creates a new SPL token mint account with the specified number of decimals and rent. 

The `new_token_account()` function creates a new SPL token account with the specified mint, owner, balance, and rent. The `new_token_account_with_pubkey()` function creates a new SPL token account with the specified account `Pubkey`, mint, owner, balance, and rent. 

The `new_owned_account()` function creates a new account with the specified unpadded length, owner `Pubkey`, and rent. The `new_dex_owned_account_with_lamports()` function creates a new account with the specified unpadded length, number of lamports, and program `Pubkey`. 

The `new_spl_token_program()`, `new_system_program()`, and `new_marginfi_program()` functions create new Solana program accounts for the SPL token, system, and MarginFi programs, respectively. 

The `new_oracle_account()` function creates a new Pyth oracle account with the specified rent, native price, mint, and mint decimals. 

The `new_rent_sysvar_account()` function creates a new rent sysvar account with the specified rent. 

The `new_vault_account()` function creates a new SPL token account for a bank vault with the specified vault type, mint `Pubkey`, owner `Pubkey`, and bank `Pubkey`. It returns the account info and seed bump. 

The `new_vault_authority()` function creates a new vault authority account with the specified vault type and bank `Pubkey`. It returns the account info and seed bump. 

The `reset()` function resets the `Bump` allocator. 

The `AccountInfoCache` struct provides a way to cache and revert changes to a set of `AccountInfo` instances. The `new()` function creates a new `AccountInfoCache` instance from a slice of `AccountInfo` instances. The `revert()` function reverts the changes made to the `AccountInfo` instances. 

The `get_vault_address()` function returns the vault address and seed bump for the specified bank and vault type. The `get_vault_authority()` function returns the vault authority address and seed bump for the specified bank and vault type. 

The `set_discriminator()` function sets the discriminator for an account with the specified `Discriminator` type.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AccountsState` struct and its methods?
- The `AccountsState` struct is used to create and manage various types of Solana accounts, such as Solana system accounts, SPL token accounts, and Pyth oracle accounts. Its methods allow for the creation of these accounts with specific parameters, such as the amount of lamports or the mint pubkey.

2. What is the purpose of the `AccountInfoCache` struct and its methods?
- The `AccountInfoCache` struct is used to store a cache of account data and account info objects. Its `new` method takes in an array of `AccountInfo` objects and creates a cache of their data. Its `revert` method sets the data of each `AccountInfo` object in the cache back to its original value.

3. What is the purpose of the `set_discriminator` function?
- The `set_discriminator` function is used to set the discriminator of an account. The discriminator is a unique identifier that is used to differentiate between different types of accounts. This function takes in an `AccountInfo` object and sets its discriminator to the value specified by the `Discriminator` trait implemented by the account's struct.
